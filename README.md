# friend-finder

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node, JavaScript, jQuery, API, JSON

This full stack app takes user responses from a survey form, pushes results in JSON format to an API, and then compares that user's scores with scores from previous users in order to find the current user's best match. Once the best match is found, a Bootstrap modal appears with the name and photo of the best match. The data is persistent only through the server session.

Points to scale: 
* Build out a more appealing UI
* Add validation to the survey form so that users cannot submit without the necessary info
